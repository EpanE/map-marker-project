# Map Marker Project

Create and manage interactive maps directly from your desktop. This repository contains a suite of
Tkinter + Folium utilities for building collections of geographic markers, previewing the results in a browser,
and exporting shareable artifacts such as HTML maps, CSV projects, and screenshots.

Although several exploratory scripts live in the repository, the most feature-complete experience is located in
[`my_map_marker_tool/main.py`](my_map_marker_tool/main.py). The other Python scripts represent earlier experiments or
single-purpose helpers (for example, different UI layouts or Excel reformatting utilities). Sample spreadsheet data
and previously rendered maps are included so you can explore the app without starting from scratch. The sections below
summarize the different entry points so you can quickly pick the workflow that best matches your needs.

## Features

- **Interactive desktop UI** – Add, edit, delete, and search markers inside a Tkinter-powered interface.
- **Flexible marker metadata** – Store latitude, longitude, display label, icon, and color for each marker.
- **Spreadsheet integration** – Import markers from `.xlsx` files and export the working set to `.csv` for later reuse.
- **Map generation** – Render an interactive Folium map (`marked_map.html`) with your markers and open it in the
  default browser. Advanced versions add zoom controls and custom tile styles.
- **Image export (experimental)** – `Enchancedlvl5_map_marker.py` automates Chromium to capture a PNG snapshot of the
  generated map.

### Script catalog

| Script | Highlights |
| ------ | ---------- |
| `my_map_marker_tool/main.py` | Full-featured Tkinter desktop app with marker CRUD, search, Excel/CSV import-export, and Folium map generation. |
| `Enchanced_map_marker.py` | Early UI with a streamlined widget layout—good reference for minimal setups. |
| `Enchancedlvl2_map_marker.py` | Adds better list management and marker editing convenience shortcuts. |
| `Enchancedlvl3_map_marker.py` | Introduces filtering/search UX refinements. |
| `Enchancedlvl4_map_marker.py` / `_betterUI.py` | Explores alternative styling, including icon previews. |
| `Enchancedlvl5_map_marker.py` | Selenium-powered PNG exporter for capturing map screenshots. |
| `UIMapMarking.py` | Lightweight interface aimed at rapid marker entry without the full project save/load stack. |
| `Basic Map Creation CSV.py` / `BasicMapCreationXLSX.py` | Standalone utilities that import data and immediately build a Folium map—handy for automation. |
| `Excel_formatting_lvl1.py` | Normalizes spreadsheets into the column schema expected by the UI tools. |
| `OPM_currentlvl3.py` | Example of a specialized marker workflow that can serve as inspiration for domain-specific variants. |

> **Tip:** When experimenting with a new feature, copy the closest existing variant and document your changes so future
> contributors can decide which script best matches their use case.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or later (Tkinter is bundled with most standard Python distributions).
- pip for installing dependencies.
- Google Chrome (or Chromium) if you intend to use the PNG export workflow in `Enchancedlvl5_map_marker.py`.

### Installation

1. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
2. Install the dependencies that power the main GUI:
   ```bash
   pip install folium pandas Pillow openpyxl
   ```
   The file [`my_map_marker_tool/requirement.txt`](my_map_marker_tool/requirement.txt) lists a broader set of packages
   that were used while experimenting with this codebase. Most of them are not required for the core map marker
   workflow, but you can install the full list if you want a bit-for-bit recreation of the original environment.

### Launch the UI

Run the main application and start adding markers:

```bash
python my_map_marker_tool/main.py
```

Key actions inside the app:

- **Add/Update marker** – Fill in the fields for name, color (hex or named color), latitude, longitude, and icon; press
  **Add/Update Marker**. Double-click a marker in the list to load it back into the form for editing.
- **Search** – Filter the list by label, color, or coordinates.
- **Create Map** – Generates `marked_map.html` and opens it in your default browser.
- **Load from Excel** – Import rows that contain `Latitude`, `Longitude`, `Label`, `Color`, and optional `Icon` columns.
- **Save/Load Project** – Persist the current markers to a CSV file and reload them later.
- **Delete Marker** – Remove the selected entry from the working set.

### Optional: Export a PNG snapshot

`Enchancedlvl5_map_marker.py` extends the UI with zoom level controls, map tile selectors, and the ability to export the
map as `marked_map.png`. To use the screenshot feature you need Selenium and the Chrome WebDriver Manager:

```bash
pip install selenium webdriver-manager
python Enchancedlvl5_map_marker.py
```

When you click **Export as Image** the script launches a headless Chrome session, renders the HTML map, and captures a
screenshot.

### Data and assets

- **Sample spreadsheets** (`world_coordinates*.xlsx`, `world_coordinates - for webstite.csv`, etc.) demonstrate the
  column layout expected by every import routine.
- **`icons/`** holds a curated set of PNG assets that can be referenced from the Tkinter apps when you want to visualize
  markers directly in the desktop UI.
- **`marked_map.html` / `marked_map.png`** are previously generated outputs. Feel free to delete them locally—new copies
  will be created whenever you run the map builders.

If you introduce new sample data, store it in the repository root or a dedicated `data/` directory and describe the
columns in this README so teammates know how to consume it.

## Data format

Spreadsheet import/export expects the following columns:

| Column      | Description                                     |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `Latitude`  | Decimal latitude (e.g., `40.7128`)               |
| `Longitude` | Decimal longitude (e.g., `-74.0060`)             |
| `Label`     | Marker popup text                               |
| `Color`     | Folium marker color (`red`, `blue`, `#RRGGBB`, …) |
| `Icon`      | Optional icon name (defaults to `info-sign`)     |

Use the sample spreadsheets in the repository (`world_coordinates.xlsx`, etc.) as templates for structuring your own
marker collections.

## Contributing

Feel free to experiment with new layouts or folium features—many of the existing scripts started that way. If you add a
new prototype, keep any generated HTML or PNG outputs out of version control (see `.gitignore`) and document how to run
it in this README.

### Development tips

- Run `pip freeze > requirements.txt` inside your virtual environment if you need to capture an exact dependency set for
  future reproducibility. Commit the file alongside updates to the tooling that require those packages.
- Tkinter layout issues can usually be diagnosed by enabling the `ttk.Style().theme_names()` helper inside the scripts
  to quickly toggle between themes.
- Folium renders use Leaflet under the hood—open the generated HTML file and use the browser dev tools if you need to
  debug marker styles or custom tile layers.
